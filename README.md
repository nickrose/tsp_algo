# TSP ALGO
Some basic functionality for generating, plotting, and solving traveling
salesman route-planning problems.

Implements a basic greedy nearest neighbors approach
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search) as well as using
Dijkstra (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
for intermediate route finding.

To get started, just just `interesting_paths.ipynb` in Jupyter notebook and
execute the cells.

As far as setup, first make sure to run `python setup.py develop` in the
from the `tsp_algo` folder, this
should attempt to install all required packages. Then try running the
Jupyter notebook.
